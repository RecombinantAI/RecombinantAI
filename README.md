- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @RecombinantAI

This is a public workspace for my ChatGPT plugin for authorized Recombinant AI+ users!  
The free tier of my plugin allows read-only functions, however in order to unlock the full power of RAI, you need room to play!
This is by NO means meant to be your private coding environment. This is a sandbox that will help your workflow when using Recombinant AI and ChatGPT.
Until I get user level authentication set up, or OpenAI integrates it with ChatGPT, this is my temporary solution for premium users who dont want to clutter their own repos. 
The trick to getting real results from RAI is to point it at a repo and empower it to make changes directly to the code. If you get to a point where you want to move closer to production, 
be sure to offload your code. 

THESE REPOS WILL STAY PUBLIC SO BE AWARE.

Have fun playing!
